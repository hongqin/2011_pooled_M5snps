#CompleteYeastFeatures.tab										
#
#This file was generated by David Gresham 10/13/2006
#
#To make this file I took the SGD_features.tab file and removed all features specified as CDS.
#Then I took the NotFeature.fasta file from SGD, extracted the headers and reformatted the information so the columns match the SGD_features.tab file.
#Finally I concatenated the two files and sorted them based on chromosome number, start position and end position.
#It looks like the Intergenic regions have inserted themselves at the right place, however use at your own risk.
#
#Following the SGD_features.tab file format I have included the following information:
#
#	<Primary SGDID> simply replaced with S00000000DG
#	<Feature Type> intergenic
#	<Feature name> between geneA and geneB
#	<chromosome> 
#	<start>
#	<stop>
